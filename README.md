#Python Clip Scripts

This repo is to manipulate data from the Windows clipboard
Still figuring out how to make this script run continuously as a service does

So, with a keybind, the last item in the clipboard can be manipulated.
So far, can manipulate strings into snake_case and camelCase

This is by no means even close to being finished or functional
