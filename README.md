# Python Clip Scripts

This repo is to manipulate data from the Windows clipboard
Still figuring out how to make this script run continuously as a service does

So, with a keybind, the last item in the clipboard can be manipulated.
So far, can manipulate strings into snake_case and camelCase

This is by no means even close to being finished or functional

## TODO

<ul>
    <li>Want this to run on bootup, so, gotta figure out a way to run this package like a service.</li>
    <li>Should create a main module in the main python_clip_scripts package to run everything easily without having to dig for the listener.py to start things.</li>
</ul>
